# Password Generator


I decided to create the password generator with strings by storing my desired password charactes in string variables. 
I then stored those strings in an array based on the user's choice with prompts. Every time the user clicks ok on the prompt, the 
desired password characters would be added to an empty array. I used for loops in order to store the user value in an array to add the desired password chacters to a new array.

I added the elements in the empty array into a new string, and then randomized the string characters to create the password with a for loop and math.random. I would like to find a better way to validate the user's length input for the password size in the future.
